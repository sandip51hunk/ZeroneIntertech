        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>We are a tech company motivated to build the most efficient system to help humanity to build a better society and culture. Our mission is to create an ecosystem where trucks can easily connect to their loads, and shippers can experience the reliable and professional service from their carriers. Though we are only targeting full truck load at the beginning, we will be launching a full-fledged one stop logistic platform soon.
        </p>
        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p>We aspire to unite Nepal by creating a collaborative and harmonious network where stakeholders will work together to build a sector which, contrary to its present-day state, will be known for its safety, reliability, transparency, precision and the ability to create value for our shippers and carriers. <br /> The core of whatever is done at LoadNepal is rooted strongly in this wider purpose. While we started with a mission to make logistics simpler, we are driven by the opportunity to make Nepal’s logistics partners and services world-class through data and technology while also building the country’s most inspirational place to work at.
